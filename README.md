# nonogram_inferred_solution
In this program, I will add an inference module to nonograms (i.e., a procedure that can deduce information about the content of individual pixels by analyzing the specification of a row or column, and then use this knowledge to deduce the value of other pixels by considering column specifications and so on).

Input file: zad_input.txt
Output file: zad_output.txt

To run all tests: python validator.py zad1 python main.py
